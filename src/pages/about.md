I’m an experienced front-end developer and lead developer for cross-functional Scrum/Kanban teams. I’ve recently transitioned to
engineering management, trying to make everyone on my team an even better developer than myself.

I love to share my knowledge and experience, by means of my
[personal blog](/), [talks and workshops](/talks), [open-source projects](/projects), or as a [lecturer](https://www.fh-ooe.at/campus-hagenberg/studiengaenge/master/interactive-media/personen/lektorinnen/) at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria.

I’m also a versatile digital artist, creating content for real-time applications, film and animation. Since secondary school I’ve developed many games with my friends.

You can contact me via [GitHub](https://github.com/Lorti), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manuelwieser) or [office@manuelwieser.com](mailto:office@manuelwieser.com). I’m available for speaking and workshops, talking about web design and development, game asset creation and challenges we’ve faced at [karriere.at](https://www.karriere.at).
