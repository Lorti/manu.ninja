Here youâ€™ll find a selection of open-source projects Iâ€™ve created or contributed to, as well as personal and professional work. As
soon as I find the time Iâ€™ll add games and digital art projects.

Thereâ€™s a list of featured projects and a chronological list of projects. Also I try to actively maintain all of my open-source projects, if theyâ€™re not marked as deprecated.


{% set chronologicalProjects = projects %}
{% set featuredProjects = projects | selectattr('featured') %}

## Featured Projects âœ¨

{% set projects = featuredProjects %}
{% include 'partials/projects.njk' %}

## Projects <small>(Chronological ðŸ“…)</small>

{% set projects = chronologicalProjects %}
{% include 'partials/projects.njk' %}
