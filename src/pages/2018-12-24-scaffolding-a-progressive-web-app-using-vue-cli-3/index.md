![Scaffolding a Progressive Web App using Vue CLI 3](/images/vue-cli-3-pwa/scaffolding-a-progressive-web-app-using-vue-cli-3.jpg)

Vue CLI 3 has been released and it's completely different from its previous version. Discover how it simplifies your toolchain, reduces configuration fatigue and improves your developer experience.

This guide is intended for beginners who've never used Vue as well as veterans who've already used Vue CLI 2 and wish to quickly start building projects with Vue CLI 3.

## Vue? Vue CLI?

> Vue (/vjuː/) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. 

You may already heard that, if you've stumbled upon this guide. The word "progressive" means, that there's a very quick learning curve as you can start to use just a little of what the framework provides and gradually use and learn more and more concepts. But what is the Vue CLI?

The first and second versions of the Vue CLI have been primarily a tool for scaffolding Vue projects. After the CLI had prepared a project for you you wouldn't need or use the Vue CLI anymore. The Vue CLI 3 is different, in that it is meant as a companion for Vue developers. It's a full system for rapid Vue development that you'll be using constantly while developing your application.

> Vue CLI is a <strike>tool for scaffolding Vue projects</strike> full system for rapid development.

The new CLI is also more in line with Vue's goals of being a progressive framework. Whereas the Vue CLI 2 scaffolded a large project with 500-1000 lines of configuration code in multiple files for you (when using the webpack template), the Vue CLI 3 hides away this complexity and let's you start with a very simple setup, allowing you to fully customize its parts and go deeper as soon as, and only if, you need it.

## Install Vue CLI 3

The first thing to do, obviously, is to install Vue CLI 3. Like with any command-line tool, the Vue.js team recommends to globally install Vue CLI 3. However, before you do that, you should remove Vue CLI 2, to avoid any conflicts caused by remaining files. 

For both removing Vue CLI 2 and installing Vue CLI 3 you can use the package manager you prefer (npm or Yarn) and run the following commands:

```bash
npm uninstall vue-cli -g
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

```bash
yarn global remove vue-cli
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

Take note, that the Vue CLI 3 package is `@vue/cli`, not `vue-cli`. Every npm package that has to do with Vue CLI 3 is prefixed with `@vue`.

## Create a new project

You now have a global `vue` tool which you can use to do various things. Run `vue --help` to get a list of all commands. The first command we'll be using is `vue create`. You call it with the name of the application you want to create:

```bash
vue create my-project
```

The Vue CLI then presents you with a few prompts. These kinds of prompts will show up often when working with the Vue CLI.

It asks you to pick a preset or manually select your application's features. For this example we'll be going the manual route, so that we can start with a simple and minimal application. Select only `Babel` and `Linter` (`ESLint + Airbnb`) and place all config in `package.json`.

![Vue CLI v3.0.3
  ? Please pick a preset: Manually select features
  ? Check the features needed for your project: Babel, Linter
  ? Pick a linter / formatter config: ESLint + Airbnb config
  ? Pick additional lint features: Lint on save
  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, PostCSS, ESLint, etc.? In p
  ackage.json
  ? Save this as a preset for future projects? No](/images/vue-cli-3-pwa/vue-create.png)

The CLI will then download and resolve the necessary dependencies, install CLI plugins and print progress output. When it's done you can open the created folder and run `npm run serve`, which will fire up a hot-reloading development server at `http://localhost:8080/`.
 
```bash
cd my-project
npm run serve
```

Let's now inspect the generated folder and you'll find 4 directories with 10 files:

```txt
my-project
├── README.md
├── babel.config.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── index.html
└── src
    ├── App.vue
    ├── assets
    │   └── logo.png
    ├── components
    │   └── HelloWorld.vue
    └── main.js
```

If you are familiar with Vue CLI 2 you'll notice right away, that these are way fewer files with even fewer lines of code (compared to running `vue init webpack my-project` back then). That means the projects generated by Vue CLI 3 are easier to understand and demand less time and effort to get an overview of.

The same is true for the project's `package.json` file. Whereas a project created with Vue CLI 2 had dozens of dependencies listed, our application only has five depencendies (this of course depends on what you've selected in the prompts):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
   "vue": "^2.5.17"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
   "@vue/cli-plugin-babel": "^3.0.3",
   "@vue/cli-plugin-eslint": "^3.0.3",
   "@vue/cli-service": "^3.0.3",
   "vue-template-compiler": "^2.5.17"
  }
}
```

We'll get into the details of the `@vue` packages in the next sections. Before that let's head to the `scripts` field.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "vue-cli-service serve",
    "build": "vue-cli-service build"
  }
}
```

When you've run `npm run serve` you might have already noticed, that npm runs the `vue-cli-service serve` command. The `vue-cli-service` is a binary that was installed when creating the project. It provides a `serve` and `build` command which take over tasks that have been previously (in Vue CLI 2) been set up in each project individually. 

The `vue-cli-service` is what allows the Vue CLI 3 to scaffold projects without hundreds of lines of webpack configuration. It strips away a lot of configuration while also allowing you to benefit from updates to the `vue-cli-service`, without having to adjust your project's configuration. In Vue CLI 2 updates to a template would go by your project unnoticed, if you did not invest the time to manually apply updates and resolve conflicts.

## Add and configure the official Progressive Web App plugin

```bash
vue add @vue/pwa
```

`@vue/cli-plugin-pwa`

`vue.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  pwa: {
    name: 'Japanese Phrasebook',
    themeColor: '#f44336',
    msTileColor: '#f44336',
    iconPaths: {
      favicon32: 'img/icons/favicon-32x32.png',
      favicon16: 'img/icons/favicon-16x16.png',
      appleTouchIcon: 'img/icons/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png',
      maskIcon: 'img/icons/safari-pinned-tab.svg',
      msTileImage: 'img/icons/msapplication-icon-144x144.png',
    },
    workboxOptions: {
      cacheId: 'phrasebook',
      importWorkboxFrom: 'local',
      navigateFallback: 'shell.html',
      navigateFallbackWhitelist: [/^((?!\/404).)*$/],
    },
  },
};
```

## Configure webpack

```js
// vue.config.js
module.exports = {
 configureWebpack: {
   plugins: [
     new MyPlugin()
   ],
 }
};
```

```js
module.exports = {
 configureWebpack: config => {
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
     // You can mutate the config directly …
   }
   // … or return an object which will be merged.
 }
};
```

```js
module.exports = {
 chainWebpack: config => {
   config
     .plugin('html')
     .tap(args => {
       return [/* … */]
     })
 }
};
```

## Troubleshoot relative file imports

[Documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/html-and-static-assets.html#building-a-multi-page-app)

> Internally, we use `file-loader` to determine the final file location with version hashes and correct public base paths, and use `url-loader` to conditionally inline assets that are smaller than 4kb, reducing the amount of HTTP requests.

```html
<img src="./assets/logo.svg" alt="Logo">
<!-- becomes -->
<img src="./assets/logo.ec9a16c8.svg" alt="Logo">
```

```bash
vue inspect --rule svg
```

```
{
  test: /\.(svg)(\?.*)?$/,
  use: [{
    loader: 'file-loader',
    options: { name: 'img/[name].[hash:8].[ext]' }
  }]
}
```

`vue.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  chainWebpack: (config) => {
    config.module.rules.delete('svg');
    config.module.rule('images')
      .test(/\.(svg|png|jpe?g|gif|webp)(\?.*)?$/);
  }
};
```

```html
<img src="./assets/logo.svg" alt="Logo">
<!-- becomes (after modifying default config) -->
<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,..." alt="Logo">
```

## Prerendering pages for SEO

[PrerenderSPAPlugin](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin)

`vue.config.js`

```js
const path = require('path');
const cheerio = require('cheerio');
const PrerenderSPAPlugin = require('prerender-spa-plugin');

module.exports = {
  configureWebpack: (config) => {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      return {};
    }
    return {
      plugins: [
        new PrerenderSPAPlugin({
          staticDir: config.output.path,
          routes: ['/', '/404', /* … */],
          renderer: new PrerenderSPAPlugin.PuppeteerRenderer({
            renderAfterDocumentEvent: 'rendered',
          }),
          postProcess(context) {
            if (context.route === '/404') {
              context.outputPath = path.join(config.output.path, '/404.html');
            }
            const $ = cheerio.load(context.html);
            $('[src*="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"]').remove();
            context.html = $.html();
            return context;
          },
        }),
      ],
    };
  }
};
```
