For the last few weeks I have build an open-source [Japanese Phrasebook](https://www.japanese-phrasebook.com) app optimized for travel and offline usage. The app's content are 690+ phrases I have taken from Wikitravel and transformed to a structured data model. This blog post explains my motivation and outlines what I am trying to achieve with this project.

The app is free for everyone to use at [https://www.japanese-phrasebook.com](https://www.japanese-phrasebook.com). You can add it to your mobile device's home screen and use it while traveling Japan, even when you have no internet connection. 

If you are interested in contributing or learning from the app's source code, open the [GitHub](https://github.com/Lorti/phrasebook) repository.
