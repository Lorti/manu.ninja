use cases for WebGL

apart from Chrome Experiments and technical demonstrations

WebGL is a cross-platform, royalty-free web standard for a low-level 3D graphics API based on OpenGL ES, exposed to ECMAScript via the HTML5 <canvas> element. 
WebGL brings plugin-free 3D to the web, implemented right into the browser. Major browser vendors Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla (Firefox) are members of the WebGL Working Group.

OpenGL ES is a cross-platform API for rendering advanced 2D/3D graphics on embedded and mobile systems (consoles, phones, appliances, vehicles…). 
It consists of a well-defined subset of OpenGL suitable for low-power devices, and provides a flexible and powerful interface between software and graphics acceleration hardware.
OpenGL ES is the “most widely deployed 3D graphics API in history”.

## 3D Model Marketplaces

[Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/)

[![](/images/webgl-examples/.png)]()

Sketchfab is empowering a new era of creativity by making it easy for anyone to publish and find 3D content online. With a community of millions of creators who have published millions of models, we are the largest platform for immersive and interactive 3D. Additionally, our store allows thousands of buyers and sellers to transact in confidence using our realtime 3D viewer and model inspector. 
Our technology is integrated with every major 3D creation tool and publishing platform, and is compatible with every browser and most VR headsets. Our player is embeddable anywhere on the web, and lets you view and share 3D and VR content on social media such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit.

We started Sketchfab in Paris, France, in early 2012. We were frustrated to see so many 3D creators spending hours on making great 3D models, but ending up sharing boring screenshots as there was no better solution to showcase their work
