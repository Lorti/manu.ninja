This is the second part in a series on creating a game with RxJS 5, Immutable.js and three.js.

You can test the game loop on [CodePen], or take a look at the full [Corsair] game, which we're going to develop in this series. All parts of the series will be listed in my [Functional Reactive Game Programming – RxJS 5, Immutable.js and three.js], if you want to read them.
