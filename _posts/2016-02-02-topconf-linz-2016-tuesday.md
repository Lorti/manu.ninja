## Opening Keynote: One size does not fit all: Carving up stuff for fun and profit -- Stefan Tilkov

(Micro-)services, bounded contexts, components, modules, classes, structs and records, procedures and functions – whatever structuring mechanism we’re talking about, a recurring challenge is to find the right size for things. Opposing forces influence our decisions from both technical and organizational perspectives, and strategies for finding a good balance are few and far between. Let’s take a closer look at what works, what doesn’t, and why.

## The web is getting pushy -- Phil Nash

The battle between native and web rages on. The browsers are fighting hard to tear down the benefits that native developers have relied on since the inception of mobile platforms. Geolocation, sorted. Accelerometer, done. Performance, we'll come back to that. But one of the greatest draws for native developers has been push notifications, for the web, email alerts just don't cut it.

But now, new in browsers for 2015, is the Service Worker. Born out of the struggle to make the Appcache work for offline capable sites it has also brought the advent of push notifications to the web. Through building up an example application live we will see how to implement the Service Worker to not only serve up an app when we're offline but enhance the online experience with push notifications.

The battle may continue, but the web is definitely pushing back.

## Punishment Driven Development -- Louise Elliot

When things go wrong the first thing we do is find who is to blame and the second thing is to punish them. This talk deives into why humans have this tendency to blame and punish. It looks at real examples of punishment within the software world and the results which were achieved. These stories not only cover managers punishing team members but also punishment within teams and self-punishment. We are all guilty of some of the behaviours discussed.

This is aimed at everyone involved in software development. After the talk attendees will understand:
•	Why we tend to blame and punish others.
•	The impact of self-blame.
•	The unintended (but predictable) results from punishment.
•	The alternatives to punishment, which get real results.

## There is no half-remote team -- Markus Tacker

Having remotes on the team enables you to hire for talent and not for availability. From my recent positions I learned that it is critical to encode remote work in every team members work habits-even if they are working on location. In this talk I would like to show you how I've set up my teams in the past and what I did to integrate remotes in our physical office (yes, we still have one).

## Breeding unicorn developers -- Tim Bourguignon

What does the next generation of IT-professionals look like? If I believe the rumors, the guides, the white noise on the internet and what my clients are searching for, the new hire is an excellent, cheap, "T-Shaped" newbie with a lot of experience, the right agile mindset and she's ready to be a cultural fit for big and small companies alike.

Those unicorns do exist, but the majority of students leaving universities today have no clue what we need. Are they to blame? Have we clearly expressed what we need already? Have we defined how we intend to push them even further?

This talk will go over the three most important relations of the software engineer: relation to code, to your peers and to yourself. Through practical examples and testimonials, we will explore how some successful software engineers have reflected on their careers and helped juniors, veterans and managers alike tweak their expectations for the future generation

## Show me your office and I'll tell you how productive you are! -- Thomas Turner

Different kinds of work need different environment. This seems to be logical, though many companies miss to support their employees with an optimized, supporting office-concept.

Due to studies 50-90% of employees are dissatisfied with their personell job-situation. Key-factors are bad work-climate, low efficiency, slow communication, high stress-level and low comfort factor.

Why and how should CEOs and managers think about their work-culture and office-structure? Why will innovation be supported by new and different rooms? This firsthand report of a reference project, the middle- and long-term conclusions will answer these and many more questions and will give you a lot to think.

## Agile Leadership – Is a Servant Leader always the Right Approach?

There is an accepted wisdom within the Agile community that the right management style is that of the Servant Leader, one who is there to serve the team as a ‘first among equals’. They are not the manager of the team, as the team is self-organising, but rather they remove impediments and coach the team in agile best practices. However, just blindly following this approach in every circumstance can be catastrophic.

This talk is aimed at Scrum Masters and team members. After the talk attendees will understand:
•	the definition of a servant leader and what this means in practice
•	the difference between management and leadership
•	how to assess the current situation in order to decide the most appropriate leadership style
•	when to change leadership style for maximum results
•	that a true servant leader is about giving the team what they need, not necessarily what they want

## Keynote: HTTP/2: Current Status -- Simone Bordet

HTTP 2.0 is supposed to be the next big thing for the web, after the overwhelming success of HTTP 1.1. In this keynote we will examine the HTTP 2.0 protocol, what is the status of its specification, what features does it offer over HTTP 1.1, and how websites can benefit (in speed and money) from it. Finally, we will explore the status of HTTP 2.0 support in the Java platform, finishing up with a demo of new HTTP 2.0 features.
