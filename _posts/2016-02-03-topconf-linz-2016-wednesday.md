I have seen front-end, security and product development talks on the [third day](http://topconf.com/linz-2016/schedule/2016-02-03/) of Topconf Linz 2016. Here are my notes from these talks.

## Panel: Modern Application Architectures -- Agim Emruli, Michael Ploed, Simone Bordet, Rachel Andrew, Jürgen Höller and Phil Nash

This panel discussion with various conference speakers will highlight current architectural trends from several perspectives: Java and JavaScript, backend and frontend, microservices and web applications. Come join us for a lively discussion and take the opportunity to raise your own questions to the panelists!

## CSS for Software Engineers for CSS Developers -- Harry Roberts

[Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/css-for-software-engineers-for-css-developers)

Depending on where you draw your measurements from, the first programming languages for use on ‘modern’ electric computers were designed in the ’40s and ’50s. CSS, on the other hand, is a mere adolescent—born in 1996, it’s just 18 years old. This means that software engineers have had over four decades’ head start on us: we should be listening to a lot more of what they have to say.

In this talk, we’ll take a look at some very traditional computer science and software engineering paradigms and how we can steal, bend, borrow, and reimplement them when writing our CSS. Writing CSS like software engineers so that we can become better CSS developers.

## We're going in: The 3D web -- Martin Naumann

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-v4bmNMN4jum0K5GtJRyldP4U9VZVrDH5BgU6ZW8g3I/)

The modern web is tearing down the borders of the browser window and allows us to create so much more than just another website.
This talk is a whirlwind tour of how 3D and virtual reality can be woven into entirely new applications that the web hasn’t seen yet. On top of interactive 3D web applications with WebGL we’ll go through the history of 3D on the web.
In addition we’ll see how we can unlock the powers of the GPU thanks to GLSL.

We will then explore the amazing superpowers that Virtual Reality is currently bringing to the web and teleport us to places we can’t go.

This talk is accompanied by use case demonstrations along with a bit of live coding as the "frosting" on top.

## Your Web Stack Would Betray You In An Instant -- Tim Perry

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDX_oVahNV0)

Securely setting up a web stack today is a tricky balancing act, as you gingerly balance frameworks and services and tools all atop one another, ever higher, to get all mod cons happily running together safely and correctly. One security flaw though, and the whole pile tumbles down on you to throw your customer passwords to the world.

In this talk we take a stroll down through a modern web stack and examine some recent major security breakages in each layer to see how they work and why. With any luck we can work out how to avoid this sort of thing in future too, when either using or building such tools, but if all else fails we can at least relax from all the careful balancing with a little schadenfreude.

## You're doing it wrong - Why your technology stack doesn't matter for your product's success -- Benjamin Reitzammer

@benjamin

When I get to talk to people about the product I'm working on, the first thing many if not most of them ask me about is the technology stack we use. Often followed by our process for making the decision for that specific stack in the first place.

While a little more than two years ago, when we were making that decision, I very likely would have asked the same things, after a while I began to think, that we as an industry are doing it all wrong. The choice of our technology or stack or even programming language, the things we so often argue or even fight about, actually don't really matter when it comes to a product's success.

But then, what matters? What are the things and factors that help to make your product successful? Of course other disciples like Design, UX, Product Management and then some are all hugely important.

Still, encompassing all those and how we do technology, are principles and practices that make our endeavors successful. It's how we treat each other in a team, it's how we conduct our work, how we arrive at the principles that guide and shape a team's work.

In this talk I'll share the story of how my team and myself did these things at our current product, a startup in the financial technology space.

I'll share practices, which you can apply at your workplace no matter if you're a developer or manager, that will help you make your product a success, by shaping the things that actually matter.

## An Abusive Relationship with AngularJS – About the Security Adventures with the "Super-Hero" Framework -- Mario Heiderich

@0x6D6172696F

Some voices claim that "Angular is what HTML would have been if it had been designed for building web applications". While this statement may or may not be true, is certainly accounts as one of the bolder ones a JavaScript web framework can ever issue. And where boldness is glistening like a German Bratwurst sausage in the evening sun, a critical review from a grumpy old security person shouldn’t be too far away.

This talk will have a stern, very stern look at AngularJS in particular and shed light on the security aspects of this ever-popular tool. Did the super-hero framework do everything right and follow its own super-heroic principles? Does AngularJS increase or rather decrease the attack surface of a web application? How does AngularJS play along with the Content Security Policy, and was it a good idea to combine this kind of security with futuristic feature creep? And what about AngularJS version 2.0?

Beware that we won’t stop at glancing at the code itself, investigating security best practices, and verifying compatibility and other common things that contribute to robust security (or lack thereof). We will cross the moral border and see if the AngularJS team could notice rogue bug tickets. A pivotal question that everyone is wondering about is: Have they successfully kept evil minds like yours truly speaker here from introducing new security bugs into the code base?

This talk is a reckoning with a modern JavaScript framework that promises a lot and keeps even more, not necessarily for the best for developers and users. We will conclude in deriving a general lesson learnt and hopefully agree that progress doesn't invariably mean an enhancement.

## Closing keynote: Hacking robot dinosaurs -- Lucy Rogers

"Come and hack our dinosaurs" – how could I resist a request like this? How I tamed dinosaurs and can train anyone to keep them under control.
